# Question 10

# Enter the first integer: 10
# Enter the second integer: 1
# Enter the third integer: 2
# Here is the equation:
# 10x10 + 1x1 + 2x2 = 100 + 1 + 4 = 105
# 2
# 7
# 0
# Enter the first integer: 2
# Enter the second integer: 7
# Enter the third integer: 0
# Here is the equation:
# 2x2 + 7x7 + 0x0 = 4 + 49 + 0 = 53

# firstStr = input('Enter the first integer: ')

# thirdStr = input('Enter the third integer: ')

# firstInt = int(firstStr)
# secondInt = int(secondStr)
